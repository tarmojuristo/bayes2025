    "## Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task focuses on understanding factors contributing to lung cancer. We are provided with the following data points for 10,000 individuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age**: The person's age. Since lung cancer risk increases with age, we did not include any individuals younger than 40.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relative Genetic Risk**: A genotyping test score estimating the individual's genetic predisposition to lung cancer compared to an \"average\" person.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Education**: The individual's highest obtained education level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pack Years Smoked**: A medical metric that quantifies smoking history. For example, smoking 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years equals 10 pack years (1 pack = 20 cigarettes). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Years Clean**: The number of years since the individual quit smoking. For those who have never smoked, this is equal to their age.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relative Air Pollution**: An estimate of the individual's exposure to air pollution, a known environmental risk factor for lung cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lung Cancer**: Binary outcome indicating whether the person has lung cancer based on an infallible supertest (1 = yes, 0 = no).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your goal** is to find out how much the different factors listed above contribute to an individuals risk of developing lung cancer. "
